# @genesyshub/cli

A CLI tool to initialize GenesysHub mock projects.

## Installation

You can run the CLI directly using:

```bash
bunx @genesyshub/cli init
```

## Important Notice

During development, some dependencies required by initialized projects are currently private:

- `@genesyshub/core`
- `@genesyshub/tools`

These packages will be made publicly available when development is complete. Until then, you won't be able to fully install dependencies for projects created with this CLI.

## Development Status

This package is currently in active development. The full functionality will be available once all dependencies are publicly released.
